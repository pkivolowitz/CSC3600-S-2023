# Sockets in Some Other Language

This is the last project of the term so let's have some fun.

By now, you have coded client / server pairs covering UDP and TCP. You
having written both single and multithreaded servers. All of these have
been in an arbitrary combination of C and C++.

For this project, pick a programming language you **don't** know.
Languages you might have covered in Paradigms are excepted from this
requirement. You are free to use one of those (Ruby, Elixir and
Clojure) if all you've seen of these languages was in Paradigms.

Using this language, learn enough of it to write a client and a server.
The client will send one line from the command line to the server. The
server will print what it received and send the same string back to the
client (which prints the reply). Then, both sides can exit. Use TCP.

## Grading

This project will be graded by your peers. You will each:

* have a total of 15 minutes where 5 minutes are reserved for questions.
You must demonstrate your program and tell us about the code. You do not
have to teach us the language but you must prove to us you learned it
well enough to have executed the project.

* grade each presentation on two criteria (each from 0 to 100). These
criteria are:

  * to what degree did the presenter convince you that they dug into the programming language - did you see evidence of effort?

  * to what degree did the presenter succeed in teaching you *something*

* write two grades (as per above) on a slip of paper and also write the
average of the two numbers. Circle the average. Write the name of the
presenter on the slip of paper (not your name).

* Pass the paper to me for final averaging of the averages.

* I reserve the right to override any grade.
